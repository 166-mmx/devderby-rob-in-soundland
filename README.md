# Rob in Soundland

My attempt to Mozilla DevDerby for topic: November 2011 Canvas

Original description:
**Show Rob a path through Soundland (using keyboard). Get the sound on each square you step on!**

The demo shows how Canvas API, Data Audio API and keyboards events can work together. As all of media files (images and sounds) are generated at the beginning, there is no necessary to use external files.

Place in contest: Second place

Update info: Data Audio API is deprecated therefore sound is not working :)
